        <p>In early Fall of 2013, we traveled from Chicago, IL to YellowStone WY.  Along Interstate 90,
            we stop in several states, Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.  Although
            each state offers its own scencic beauty, I've choosen to display several places
            within two western states, South Dakota and Wyoming.
